# fastwriter-duckhunter-scripts
This script makes it easy to write DuckHunter scripts.

this script is available in C++ and Python for your convenience.

The file itself generated by the program is saved in the same directory.

duckhunter.exe is not a virus! you can check it out on VirusTotal!(I don't know why, but 3 antiviruses say that this file is a trojan)

if you still think it's a virus, then check the DuckHunter.cpp file for viruses (if you think they are there) and compile it yourself.
